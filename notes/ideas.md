### Open

Multiple seed outputs: More complex models?  
Currently suited for single indicator output type tasks?

Consistent boxes solution?  
Data selection dependent? Distribute input areas for train and val?

Convergence to different solution types? Only in theory?

Cascade Corr?

### Closed

Fitness_func: dx, dy to target?  
Nope, because of seed growth, there is an inherent bias towards low dx, dy solutions

Just grow the seed before even modeling the weights?  
No notable consistent substrate improvement  
See results:1

Lower thres improves 3x3?  
Nope, requires more accurate modeling (than max)  
See results:2
